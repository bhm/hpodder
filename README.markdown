#About
####First time reading, doing and Haskell

###What Why and so forth
Fork of a old piece of software. I needed some feedback on what is being downloaded.
Guess patch could be more apropriate, but adding UI feedback should count as a sort of fork. Not much has been done though.

### Use of libnotify
1. Install libnotify.
2. Edit ~/.hpodder/hpodder.conf and add 
>usenotify = yes
under general section
3. ???.
4. Profit.

##TODO
* Maybe perpodcast option instead of general
* Code really needs some documentation
